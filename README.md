# YoutubeAPI
Desktop application for manipulating and reading youtube data using youtube data api
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had my youtube channel hijaked by bots, the bots would remove my subscriptions and subscribe to random low sub channels. It would also leave a random comment in random videos.
I am not quite sure what happened but this stopped happening since few months ago. I still have hundreads of channels subbed that i want to remove.
So I filtered my subscriptions that have subs lower than 7.5k and unsub them all, I would re sub to those I intentially subbed later.
While i was scratching my head to how to automate this, I learnt you can also do many other things, so I added them to their respective functions.
